Avoidance:
    It is the strategy to avoid creating a deadlock or getting into it. This can be done by Banker's Algorithm.
Prevention:
    prevent the deadlock by eleminating any of the four conditions: Mutual Exclusion, Hold and Wait, No preemption, Circular wait
    by different ways for each one.
Recovery:
    It is done through killing the process & resource preemption which can be explained in details by the three basic approaches
    Inform the system operator, and allow him/her to take manual intervention.
    Terminate one or more processes involved in the deadlock
    Preempt resources.
